# RSV_Viral_Dynamics_Study

R and Stand code for data analysis and figure repdocution for the manuscript "Relating in vivo RSV infection kinetics to host infectiousness in different age groups"

[Data.zip]: Viral load kinetic data for the analysis 

[fit_stan_model]: R script to fit Stan model

[Rstan model]: Stan model

[data_stan_53_patients.rds]: All extracted data for Stan model fit

[prediction check and posterior distribution]: plot posterior distributions and prediction check for all age groups

[Relating qprc and viral titer]: find the best model to relate qprc and viral titer

[qpcr_qculture_data.zip]: qpcr and qculter data. Note that store the data to a local pathway correspoding to the path in "Relating qprc and viral titer"

[Violin plot]: change Fig1-4 to violin plot
